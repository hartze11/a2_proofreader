Apple Automatic Proofreader from Compute! Magazine

From Wikipedia [1]:

The Automatic Proofreader is a series of checksum utilities published by COMPUTE! Publications for its COMPUTE! and COMPUTE!'s Gazette magazines, and various books. These programs are designed to allow home computer users to easily detect errors on BASIC type-in programs, and work by displaying a hash value for each line entered that can be compared against the reference value printed in the magazine. Initially published for use with the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 in 1983, the Proofreader was later made available for the Atari 8-bit family, Apple II family,[2] and IBM PC/PCjr as well.

The line-by-line "real-time" feedback feature was something of a novelty at the time and represented a significant improvement over earlier checksum utilities, which were typically run only after a user program had been entered and, due to quite simplistic checksum algorithms, had trouble catching errors like transposed characters.
